# Tuwaiq-JS
**Tuwaiq-Academey course of JavaScript programming language.**

### Exercise - Arthemetic Operations

###### Try these opreations on console:
```javascript
     let result_6 = 9 + 2;
     let result_7 = 1 - 3;
     let result_8 = 2 * 3;
     let result_9 = 6 / 2;
     let result_10 = 15 % 4;
```
### Exercise - Computation

###### Try these compute opreations:
```javascript
     let result_16 = 9 - 2 + 8;
     let result_17 = 1 - 3 + 6;
     let result_18 = 2 * (3 + 9);
     let result_19 = 6 / 2 * (1 - 5);
     let result_20 = 15 % 2 - 3 * 3;
     let result_21 = 5 % 2 + 10 / 5;
```
### Exercise - Comparasions

###### Try these comapre opreations:
```javascript
     let result_1b = 3 == 7;
     let result_2b = 10 != 8;
     let result_3b = 3 > 5;
     let result_4b = 4 >= 3;
     let result_5b = 4 < 55;
     let result_6b = 6 <= 3;
     let result_7b = 7 === 7;
     let result_8b = 7 !== 7;
```
## Homework - Day-3
```javascript
     let hw_D03_1 = 1 - 3 + 6 > 1 - 8;
     let hw_D03_2 = 2 * (3 + 9) >= 9 - 1 * 0;
     let hw_D03_3 = (6/2) * 5 <= 1 - 5;
     let hw_D03_4 = 15 % 2 > 9 - 1;
     let hw_D03_5 = 7 * 7 === '4' + '9';
     let hw_D03_6 = 7 * 7 == '4' + '9';
     let hw_D03_7 = 7 * 7 !== '4' + '9';
     let hw_D03_8 = 7 * 7 != '4' + '9';
     let hw_D03_9 = 7 > '7';
     let hw_D03_10 = 7 <= '7';
     let hw_D03_11 = 9 + 2 > 8 - 5 * 9;
```
